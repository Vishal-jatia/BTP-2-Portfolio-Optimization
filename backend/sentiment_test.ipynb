But the company isn’t taking the threat to its most important business lying down.\\n\\nDuring a hearing as part of Google’s ongoing antitrust battle over its search dominance, Apple (AAPL) senior vice president of services Eddy Cue testified that the iPhone maker saw a drop in web searches via Safari for the first time last month, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nGoogle pays Apple roughly $20 billion a year to set Google Search as the default search engine in its Safari browser. So a drop in Safari searches could mean a drop in Google Search traffic. Though Google says its search traffic continues to grow, even on Apple devices.\\n\\nCue attributed the decline to more users opting for generative AI-based services like OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) ChatGPT search and Perplexity (PEAI.PVT), adding that Apple will likely add the platforms to its search options in Safari in the future.\\n\\nAll of this comes as Google continues to battle the Justice Department’s (DOJ) efforts to convince a federal judge in its antitrust case to force the company to sell off its Chrome browser, among other elements of its search business.\\n\\nOf course, part of the DOJ’s plans include forcing Google to kill exclusivity deals like the one that helps fill Apple’s coffers. And by testifying that Apple saw a drop in Safari searches, the company could be hoping to preserve its $20 billion deal. After all, if Google is in decline, why should the court bother taking an axe to Apple’s lucrative agreement?\\n\\n“Broadly speaking, we believe Apple is hoping to avoid losing the [revenue] share agreement with [Google] that reportedly provides roughly $20 [billion] annually (DOJ remedies could mandate termination of the agreement),” TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in an investor note.\\n\\n“Within this backdrop, it's logical that [Apple] might want to discuss alternatives to Google Search in order to demonstrate to the court that Google's existing Search business faces real threats amid the emergence of Gen AI-based chatbot search platforms,” he added.\\n\\nGoogle’s battle plans\\n\\nGoogle has been on the defensive since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT in late 2022. The search giant, which was caught off guard by the app’s popularity and quickly debuted its generative AI Bard chatbot with mixed results. Since then, it renamed Bard as Gemini and released a host of high-powered generative AI models for the platform.\\n\\nGoogle also revealed its AI Overview, a box that appears above the company’s standard search results, complete with generative AI-powered responses to users’ queries. But that also had issues at first, telling people to do things like add glue to pizza to keep the cheese from sliding off or to eat rocks.\"}, {'title': \"Warren Buffett once said what the ‘best business’ can do for an 'extended period' — here are his examples\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-best-business-120000590.html', 'text': 'Investing is a noisy industry, but Warren Buffett has always been able to cut through this noise with his simple but powerful advice.\\n\\nOne of Buffet\\'s most overlooked nuggets of wisdom, among the great many he shared over decades spent burnishing his reputation as the Oracle of Omaha, is about focusing on the right type of businesses.\\n\\n“[T]he best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return,” he told his investors in 1992.\\n\\nDon\\'t miss\\n\\n\"The worst business to own,\" Buffett continued, \"is one that must, or will, do the opposite — that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return.\"\\n\\nAnd that thinking appeared to hold true for the following 30-odd years, as Buffett continued to achieve world-beating success as an investor and executive.\\n\\nIt seemed as if he might go on forever.\\n\\nBut, finally, at 94 years old, Buffett decided to retire from his longtime post as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announcing the decision at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in early May. At the time of the announcement, which rocked the business world, he was ranked fifth on the Forbes real-time billionaires index with a net worth of around $160 billion\\n\\nBerkshire\\'s legendary portfolio has been cited as proof of countless principles over the years, and his view of the \"best businesses\" — that they\\'re the ones that can continuously reinvest and thereby multiply their profits — has been especially hard to argue with.\\n\\nHere are some great examples.\\n\\nApple (AAPL)\\n\\nBuffett’s largest holding is the iPhone maker based in Cupertino, California. Notwithstanding a major selloff in 2024, when Berkshire Hathaway dumped roughly $80 billion of Apple stock, the company still makes up 28% of Buffett\\'s portfolio.\\n\\nThe continued popularity of the iPhone, lucrative margins in the software business and new products could sustain Berkshire\\'s stake even after Buffett\\'s vacates the CEO chair.\\n\\nRead more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has an important message for the next wave of American retirees — here\\'s how he says you can best weather the US retirement crisis'}, {'title': 'Apple (AAPL) Scrambles to Regain Chinese Market Share as Trade War Intensifies', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-scrambles-regain-chinese-092508266.html', 'text': 'Global tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL), long dominant in the smartphone and personal computing markets, is now grappling with significant headwinds in China that will likely weigh on growth in the near term. As anticipated, the company is beginning to address these issues, driven by the absence of a foldable smartphone offering and underwhelming AI capabilities.\\n\\nProtect Your Portfolio Against Market Uncertainty\\n\\nWhile Apple has not officially confirmed a foldable device, Bloomberg reports suggest it is close to rolling out its Apple Intelligence AI suite in China, following delays since last October. Though this marks progress, I remain neutral on the stock, as I believe the current valuation fairly reflects the company’s fundamentals, offering limited upside and little margin of safety.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) price history over the past twelve months\\n\\nApple’s Failure to Launch a Foldable Smartphone is Hurting Sales\\n\\nMy concerns regarding Apple’s continued growth stem from its poor recent performance in China, one of the company’s most important target markets, hauling in 17% of revenue in the previous financial year. Most recently, Apple’s China revenue fell 8% YoY, and in Q2 FY2025, China revenue declined over 2%, suggesting that struggles are continuing in the new financial year as well. A closer study of Apple’s performance in China reveals that the failure to launch a foldable smartphone in China has cost the company market share.\\n\\nAccording to Canalys data, Apple’s China smartphone shipments were 42.9 million in 2024, a notable 17% YoY decline. As a result, the company’s market share fell to 15%, behind Vivo and Huawei. Interestingly, both Vivo and Huawei reported strong shipment growth in 2024 (11% and 37%, respectively), which reveals Apple’s struggles are isolated.\\n\\nApple Revenue by Geography\\n\\nInterestingly, while total smartphone shipments in China grew just 4% in 2024, foldable smartphone shipments grew 27% YoY, confirming the tailwinds supporting this niche market segment. With a market share of almost 50% in the foldable smartphone segment, Huawei led the way in 2024 (four of the five best-selling foldable smartphones in 2024 were Huawei models).\\n\\nAlthough there are rumors of a foldable iPhone, Apple has yet to confirm them. As long as the company fails to cater to the surging demand for foldable smartphones in China, Apple is unlikely to reverse market share losses in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nSlow AI Progress for Apple as Competition Heats Up\\n\\nAnother factor that has kept me cautious on Apple recently is the lackluster progress the company has made with AI. In China, the lack of AI features has led to dissatisfied customers. A survey conducted by Canalys found that Chinese consumers had the strongest AI inclination among the top three smartphone markets in the world (China, the U.S., and India). Data revealed that 43% of Chinese consumers have a high AI inclination, compared to just 15% in the U.S. Although Apple’s AI deficit may not harm U.S. sales, applying the same playbook to China has already proven to be costly.'}, {'title': 'Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among Billionaire Bruce Berkowitz’s Stock Picks with Highest Upside Potential', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-among-billionaire-212726086.html', 'text': 'We recently published a list of Billionaire Bruce Berkowitz’s 6 Stock Picks with Highest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other billionaire Bruce Berkowitz’s stock picks with highest upside potential.\\n\\nOne of the most prominent hedge fund managers on Wall Street and founder of Fairholme Capital Management, billionaire Bruce Berkowitz’s track record and unique investing approach make his portfolio choices well worth a closer look. Berkowitz is renowned for his bold bets on unloved assets, his high-conviction investment style, and his rare ability to spot dollar bills being sold for pennies- and the guts to hold them until the market catches up.\\n\\nHis ability to focus on facts and ignore the market chatter has helped him deliver strong results and earned him strong accolades in the industry. Named Morningstar’s Domestic-Stock Fund Manager in 2009 and Institutional Investor Magazine’s Money Manager of the Year in 2013, his honors underscore his reputation as a value investor worth following.\\n\\nREAD NEXT: 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar Right Now and 10 AI Stocks Getting Wall Street’s Attention Right Now\\n\\nBerkowitz has always believed in owning a handful of stocks. These stocks, however, are those in which he believes deeply. After all, high-conviction investing is the name of the game.\\n\\n“You only need a few ideas in a lifetime to do unbelievably well.”\\n\\nHe is also a staunch believer in reality. Hated assets usually have hidden value, and the trick, he believes, is to look at the facts instead of reacting to trauma like others do.\\n\\n“Ignore the crowd. Count what matters.”\\n\\nIn an interview with Bill Brewster from the Business Brew, Bruce Berkowitz talked about how he started Fairholme with a simple mission: managing his family’s money. From the very beginning, Fairholme wasn’t a marketing organization. Rather, the fund’s unique approach was vested in value creation rather than asset gathering. Focusing solely on deep research and concentrated positions, Berkowitz often ran portfolios with only a few ideas.\\n\\nOver the years, Berkowitz learned how financial metrics, on which he relied with much conviction in the early years, weren’t the only factors to consider. Rather, management quality and ownership culture were equally important. This shift in perspective has made him more selective as he strongly believes that the right leadership can make or break an organization, particularly during tough times. That said, Berkowitz highlighted in the interview how he now avoids doing business with executives he doesn’t trust, regardless of how shiny the financials may seem.'}, {'title': 'Alphabet Shares Take $138 Billion Blow as Search Warnings Blare', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-shares-138-billion-blow-202310728.html', 'text': '(Bloomberg) -- For more than a year, Alphabet Inc. shareholders have fretted over long-term risks posed by artificial intelligence to the company’s money-printing search business. This week the threat became much more immediate.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nCourt testimony from an Apple Inc. executive on Wednesday revealed that the iPhone maker is exploring adding AI services to its web browser for which Google now pays an estimated $20 billion a year to be the default search engine. Potentially more worrisome: searches on Apple’s Safari fell for the first time last month, according to Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services.\\n\\nThe revelations implied that queries fielded by rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic already may be eating into Google search, which accounts for more than half of the parent company’s revenue and the vast majority of profits. Alphabet said in a subsequent blog post that search queries continue to rise, including those coming from Apple users.\\n\\nAlphabet shares ended the week down nearly 7%, while the Nasdaq 100 fell just 0.2%. The drop erased $138 billion in market value.\\n\\n“The basic issue is, will Alphabet lose its cash cow?” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. “This is the first time Alphabet has really seen competition in search since the category was originated, and we’re already seeing chinks in the armor.”\\n\\nFears that Alphabet is falling behind in AI have resulted in multiple selloffs since ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022; in February 2023, for example, the stock sank on concerns about the accuracy of its AI chatbot.\\n\\nHowever, it has shown an ability to rebound off those losses, and up until Wednesday, Alphabet had been on an upswing. The shares rallied in the days following its earnings report that showed its search advertising business remained strong in the first quarter, which ended on March 31.\\n\\nThe size and speed of Alphabet’s selloff shows how nervousness about the risks of disruption from AI — even for a company with formidable talent in the field — is overshadowing everything else and making it difficult for investors to value the tech giant.\\n\\nAlphabet has long traded at a discount to megacap peers like Microsoft Corp. But that gap has widened over the past year amid worries the YouTube owner is falling behind in AI.'}]\n"
